# Advent of Code, 2022

---

Well, I tried in 2019 (no repo) and then again last year in [2021](https://github.com/jscooksey/AdventOfCode2021), but never completed either of them. Lets see if I can stick to it this year and run through them all.

I'm already behind at this point, being 10th December 2022 and I've oinly done the first three days.
